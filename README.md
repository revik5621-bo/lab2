Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body cannot properly regulate blood glucose levels. This study uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains medical measurements such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), insulin level, age, and number of pregnancies, which are used to determine whether a person has diabetes.

Machine Learning Problem
This is a supervised binary classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features. The target variable is Outcome, where 1 indicates a diabetic patient and 0 indicates a non-diabetic patient.
